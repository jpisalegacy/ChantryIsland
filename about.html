  			Chantry Island is located on Lake Huron, just over a mile southwest of the Saugeen River mouth in 
        Southampton, Ontario.<br><br>

        On the island is a majestic Imperial Lighthouse built in the mid 1800’s, as well as the Keeper’s quarters and a boat house.<br><br>
 
        In 1822, during a hydrographic survey, Captain Henry Bayfield of the Royal Navy christened the island and named it after his friend and British sculptor Sir Francis Chantry.

        <h3 id="islandH3" class="hide">The Island</h3>
        Chantry Island is a glacial moraine and consists of stone above the water and beneath extending a mile north and a mile south of the island.<br><br> 

        These underwater shoals of massive granite boulders have made this area one of the most treacherous in the Great Lakes.<br><br>

        There are over 50 known shipwrecks around the island and there are many accounts from the 1800’s and early – mid 1900’s of these disasters and lost lives.

        Today, buoys and modern navigational tools safely guide boats through the area.<br><br>

        The island varies in size depending on the level of Lake Huron. Today, with a low lake level Chantry Island is about 68 acres. <br><br>

        In 1986 when the water level was at the highest of the century, the island was only about 10 acres, causing trees on the west, north and south sides to drown.

      <article class="small-12 large-5 large-offset-1 end column">
        <h3 id="lighthouseH3" class="hide">The Lighthouse</h3>
        During the mid 1800’s water traffic on the Great Lakes had substantially increased and the colonial government called for improved 
        navigational tools for the mariners on the Lake Huron. <br><br>

        John Brown of Thorold was contracted to build the lighthouse on Chantry Island, as well as 10 other lighthouses to help sailors navigate the Lake.<br><br> 

        Because of the expense and difficulty of building, only six were completed.<br><br>

        The Chantry Island Lighthouse was one of these completed and it was lit on April 1, 1859.

        <h3 class="hide">The Lighthouse part2</h3>
        The lighthouse stands 86 ft. above water level and is 80 ft. high from its base to the light’s center.<br><br>

        The lantern room of the lighthouse was fitted with a Fresnel lens built and transported from Paris, France. <br><br>

        The first fuel used was sperm whale oil and the first light was a fixed light, not the familiar flashing one. <br><br>

        Other fuels used have been colza oil, coal oil, kerosene, acetylene and 
        electricity. Its present-day flashing light is solar powered.

        In 1957 the Canadian Wildlife Service declared Chantry Island a Federal Migratory Bird Sanctuary to protect the migratory and nesting birds of the island.<br><br>

        It is the largest Federal Migratory Bird Sanctuary between James Bay and Point Pelee. There are approximately fifty thousand birds (including chicks) on the island during the breeding season. <br><br>

        It is home to nesting colonies of Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, Black-crowned Night-Heron, Herring Gull, Ring-billed Gull and Double-crested Cormorant.

        Water fowl such as Mallard, American Black Duck, Gadwall, Blue-winged Teal, Green-winged Teal, Northern Pintail, and American Wigeon are also known nesters on the island.<br><br>

        Because the island is a migratory bird sanctuary, the number of people on the island on any given day is strictly limited and tours must be booked through the Chantry Island Tour Base.
